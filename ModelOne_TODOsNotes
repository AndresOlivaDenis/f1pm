# TODO's:

Model One ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) Review Model One and create method function.

2)   Extend model one to multiple cases: (Be carefull with the sum-out of probabilities!)
#       - Multiple grid bets.
#       - Multiple race results.

5) Create a notebook for model one bets cases. (for bets might be nicer to see!)

6) Probabilities confidence intervals (might be really important!):

    https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats._result_classes.BinomTestResult.proportion_ci.html

Model Zero -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Create a notebook for model zero bets cases. (for bets might be nicer to see!)

4) Add functions for jointly drivers probabilities ?
#       - Griven current grid, Probs that any of two drivers win the race ?
#       - Griven current grid, Probs that any of two drivers finish in top ## ? (although this case is harder conditioning!)
#       - Griven current grid, Probs that both of two drivers finish in top ## ? (although this case is harder conditioning!)


Others ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enumarete weekness. Try to find out penalization (or security factor)
#   Add doc string descriptions with asumptions, notes, ect.. (maybe even in notebooks)

Candidate for future works (leave this for next season ? (work on it on december):
#   - Add car championship position into model parameter Â¿? (grid, Driver_championship_position, Car_championship_position)
